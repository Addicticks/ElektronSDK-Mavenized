/**
 * This package contains the UPA Value Add Reactor. The UPA Reactor is a
 * callback-based connection management and event processing component that
 * will significantly reduce the amount of code an application must write for
 * OMM-based applications. The Reactor can be used to create Consumer,
 * Interactive Provider, and Non-Interactive Provider applications. In
 * addition, the Reactor also manages automatic ping handling and outbound
 * buffer flushing for all application types, and provides automatic Consumer
 * and Non-Interactive Provider start-up processing.
