EmajConsPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------
 
The purpose of this application is to measure performance of EMA API,
decoders in consuming Level I Market Price content directly
from an OMM provider or through the Thomson Reuters Enterprise Platform.

The consumer creates two types of threads:
- A main thread, which collects and records statistical information,
- Consumer threads, each of which create a connection to a provider and
request market data.

To measure latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates by 
the provider.  The consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to
determine the end-to-end latency.  ConsPerf also supports measurement of 
posting latency.

This application also measures memory and CPU usage.  The memory usage measured 
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the 
application.  The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the 
total system time (The CPU time is the total across all threads, and as such 
this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy).  

For more detailed information on the performance measurement applications, 
see the EMA Open Source Performance Tools Guide(Docs/PerfToolsGuide.doc).

This application uses an open source C-language XML parser library.
